I'm a Ph.D. student in Graduate School of Information Science at Kyushu University, where I'm supervised by Prof. <a href="https://posl.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~kamei/">Yasutaka Kamei</a> (<a href="https://posl.ait.kyushu-u.ac.jp/ja/" target="_blank">Our lab's web here</a>) .
I received B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees from the Kyushu University (2021 and 2023).

My research topic is Software Engineering for AI/ML (SE4AI, SE4ML).
A recent topic is a repair/debugging for DNNs.
I like both practical and theoretical things!<!-- {style="text-align: justify;"} -->
